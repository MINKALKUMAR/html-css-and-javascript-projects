          In prehistory, education happened informally through oral
          communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations,
          writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This caused a
          shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education
          was mainly available to elites and religious groups. The invention of
          the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely
          availacilable to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain
          age. Today, over 90% of all primary-school-age children worldwide
          attend primary school.
